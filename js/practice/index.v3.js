// * Problem Solving
// ** If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions." -Albert Einstein

// * Problem Solving Steps:
// *todo 1. _Identify_ - the first step is to identify and understand the nature of the problem

// *todo 2.  _Research & Refine_ - at this step you should have a main problem broken down into a few subproblem

// *todo 3. _Pseudocode_
// * - focus on logic, NOT syntayear

// * - added benefit of writing pseudocode is that you can focus naming things before your code gets filled up with a bunch of other syntax

// * - goal is to write an outline for how you will implement your code

// * - the idea is tha you focus onto logic of your code without having to worry about the syntax or implementiation details

// *todo 4. _Test-Driven Development_

// *todo 5. _Implement_
// * - "Done is better than perfect"

// * - try to get it done as quicky as possible

// * - have all your test pasing abd have a working prototype in the least amount of time possible even if the code is not perfect

// * - the reason for that is psychological Solving a big problem is a coloection of small staps

// *todo 6. _Practice_ "to become really good at anything, you have to practice and repeat, practice and repeat, until the technique becomes intuitive."

// *todo 7. Repeate

// ? 8. Write a JavaScript program where the program takes a random integer between 1 to 10, the user is then prompted to input a guess number.
// ? If the user input matches with guess number, the program will display a message "Good Work" otherwise display a message "Not matched".
