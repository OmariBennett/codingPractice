# Problem Solving
"If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking
about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions."
-Albert Einstein

## Problem Solving Steps:
  1. _Identify_
      - the first step is to identify and understand the nature of the problem

  2.  _Research & Refine_
      - At this step you should have a main problem broken down into a few subproblem

      ```ex. 1. merge 600 PRs
        A. validate requersts
          A.1 query from GitHub API
          A2. merge via GitHub API
      ```

  3. _Pseudocode_
      - focus on logic, NOT syntax

      - added benefit of writing pseudocode is that you can focus naming things before
          your code gets filled up with a bunch of other syntax

      - goal is to write an outline for how you will implement your code

      - the idea is tha you focus onto logic of your code without having to worry
          about the syntax or implementiation details

  4. _Test-Driven Development_

  5. _Implement_
      - "Done is better than perfect"

      - try to get it done as quicky as possible

      - have all your test pasing abd have a working prototype in the least amount
          of time possible even if the code is not perfect

      - the reason for that is psychological Solving a big problem is a coloection of small staps

  6. _Practice_
      "To become really good at anything, you have to practice and repeat, practice and repeat,
        until the technique becomes intuitive."
        -Paulo Coelho

  7. Repeat

  ## Addational steps to improve your code
    - improve readability
    - add comments
    - remove duplication
    - optimize time / space complexity of your algorithms
    - add caching to reduce cloud computing costs
    - add error handling

It's much easier to imporove a working piece of code than it is to write a perfect piece of context on the first go around

```Problem Statement
  (context) -
    ex. (context) we must merge 600 pull requersts
    
  (iusse) - 
    *explain why this is an issue
    ex. (iusse) it would take days to click that button
    
  (summary) -
    *summarize why we should solve this problem
    ex. (summary) it will save us millions of dollars
